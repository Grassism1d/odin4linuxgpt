# odin4linuxgpt
A Odin/ADB tools app that was ENTIRELY made by chatgpt.

This was made in only a hour and a half using chatgpt prompts, Made with python.

**FEATURES**
-(some) adb tools One-click actions such as sideloading, rebooting to recovery, etc.
-A full on Odin-Like flash tool with all partitions (AP,BL,CP,CSC,HOME_CSC) and device detection using heimdall. and odin4linux!
-more features coming VERY soon...


*why did you make this abomination?*
because I was tired of the terminal and was to lazy to learn python (learning from code now lmao)


this will be frequently updated, so stay tuned, although the UI is horrible, its better than no GUI at all. Thanks for using!
